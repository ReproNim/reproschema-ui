<h2><strong>SUMMARY</strong></h2> 
<p>You are invited to participate in a research study to understand variations in symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). If you are over 18 years old, you can join the study. We are looking for volunteers with PD and volunteers who do not have PD. Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary.</p> 
<p>The purpose of this form is to help you decide if you want to join this research study. Please read the information carefully. Participating in a research study is not the same as receiving medical care. The decision to join or not join the research study will not affect your medical benefits.</p> 
<p>To join this research study you must give your informed consent. Giving your informed consent means that you understand what the study is about and want to participate.&#xa0; If you decide to participate, you can withdraw your consent and leave the study at any time.</p> 
<p>You should not join this research study until all of your questions are answered.</p> 
<p>If you join the study you will be given a copy of this form for your records.</p> 
<h2><strong>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></h2> 
<p>People with PD have different symptoms. These symptoms can change day-to-day and over time. This makes it hard to maintain quality of life and manage treatment. We would like to understand the reasons for these differences in symptoms of PD. The results of this study may help researchers develop new ways to manage PD symptoms.</p> 
<p>This study uses an app to measure the symptoms of PD. If you participate in this study, we’ll ask you to complete surveys and perform brief activities while holding your phone. These activities use your phone’s built-in sensors to measure health symptoms. You can choose to connect the app to your fitness tracker (like the Apple Watch, FitBit, or Jawbone) if you wear one.&#xa0;</p> 
<h3><em><strong>How long will I be in the research study?</strong></em>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;</h3> 
<p>This phase of the study will last about one year. You can keep the app on your phone for as long as you choose. You can use it to track your symptoms and review your data.</p> 
<h3><em><strong>How many people will take part in this study?</strong></em>&#xa0;&#xa0;</h3> 
<p>We expect 20,000 people to join this study.</p> 
<h2><strong>PROCEDURES</strong></h2> 
<p><em><strong>What will you be asked to do?</strong></em></p> 
<p>If you decide to join the study, you will need to download the mPower study app on to your phone. The app is free from your phone’s app store. Then, you will need to register for the study.</p> 
<p>After you register, we will ask you to answer survey questions on the app and to do simple activities while holding your phone. We might also send you notifications through the app. Your answers to the survey questions and the measurements from your activities are your study data.</p> 
<p>Here is more detail about what you will be asked to do:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><strong>Register to the study: </strong>Follow the prompts on the app to register. First you will see an overview of the study and read about the risks and benefits of participating.&#xa0; You will confirm your decision to participate and sign this form directly on your phone. Then you will create your account. We will ask you to enter your name, email address, and other general information about yourself. You can cancel the registration process at any time.</li> 
 <li><strong>Health Surveys</strong>: We will ask you questions about your health and your medical history. We will ask if you have PD and if you take certain medications. Because the purpose of this study is to look for patterns over time, occasionally we will ask you to review and update your answers. We will also ask questions about your mood or how well you slept.</li> 
 <li><strong>Activities</strong>: We will ask you to do simple activities while holding your phone. For example: 
  <ul> 
   <li>Say “aaah” into your phone’s microphone for 10 seconds. This is to measure variation in your voice.</li> 
   <li>Walk and/or stand still with your phone in your pocket. This is to measure your gait and balance.</li> 
   <li>Tap your fingers on your phone’s screen. This is to measure your speed and coordination.</li> 
   <li>Play a short game. In this game, flowers light up in pattern. We ask you to tap the flowers in the same pattern. This is to test your short-term memory.</li> 
   <li>Hold your phone. This is to measure tremor.</li> 
   <li>You can choose to connect the app to your fitness tracker (like the Apple Watch, FitBit, or Jawbone) if you wear one. This is to measure how active you are.</li> 
  </ul> </li> 
</ul> 
<p>This study should take you about 20 minutes each day. You can participate any time during the day. If you would like a daily reminder, you can turn on notifications in the app to remind you to complete the activities and surveys.</p> 
<p>You can participate in all or only parts of the study. Completing the activities daily is very valuable for our study, but if you can’t, once a week still helps!</p> 
<p>You can pause or quit the study at any time. Pausing the study means your data is not sent to the study for a period of time. If you pause, you can rejoin the study at any time without re-enrolling. Quitting the study means that you leave the study. No more data is collected from the app. You would need to re-enroll to start participating again.</p> 
<p>Occasionally we may re-contact you to ask for your feedback about using the app and about the kind of questions included in the study.</p> 
<h2><strong>RISKS, DISCOMFORTS, AND INCONVENIENCES</strong></h2> 
<p>There are possible risks, discomforts, and inconveniences with any research study. They deserve careful thought.</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>&#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0;This is not a medical treatment study. We do not expect medical side effects from participating in this study.</li> 
 <li>&#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0;Be safe – do not participate while driving. Wait until you are in a safe place to perform study-related activities!</li> 
 <li>&#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0;Participating in this study may generate a wide range of emotions. It could affect your mood.&#xa0; Some questions in the surveys may be mildly stressful for some people.</li> 
 <li>&#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0;Other people may glimpse the study notifications and/or reminders on your phone and realize you are enrolled in this study. This can make some people feel self-conscious.</li> 
 <li>&#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0;Data collected in this study will count against your phone’s data plan. You can configure the app to only use WiFi to limit the impact data collection has on your data plan.</li> 
 <li>&#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0;We take great care to protect your privacy. However, if there is a data breach it may be possible to identify you. This risk is low but it is not zero.</li> 
 <li>&#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0;Participation may involve risks that we don’t know about yet. We will tell you if we learn anything&#xa0;that might change your decision to be in this study.</li> 
</ul> 
<h2><strong>POTENTIAL BENEFITS</strong></h2> 
<p>The main goal of this study is increasing understanding of the symptoms of PD. We will be looking for health patterns across large groups, not individual health trends.</p> 
<p>You may or may not directly benefit from volunteering for this research study.</p> 
<p>You will be able to view and download your study data. You can share your data with your doctor or anyone you choose.</p> 
<p>The mPower app is not a personal diagnosis or treatment tool.</p> 
<h2><strong>PAYMENT</strong></h2> 
<p>You will not be paid for participating in this study. You will not be paid for sharing your data.</p> 
<h2><strong>COSTS</strong></h2> 
<p>There is no direct cost to participate in this study. There may be an indirect cost to participate. This indirect cost is because data collected in this study will count against your phone’s data plan.</p> 
<h2><strong>ALTERNATIVES</strong></h2> 
<p>This is not a medical treatment study. There is no alternative treatment to this study. The only alternative to this study is to not participate.</p> 
<h2><strong>AUTHORIZATION TO USE AND DISCLOSE INFORMATION FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES</strong></h2> 
<p>We cannot use your personal information for this research without your written authorization. If you sign this consent form, you will provide this authorization. You will authorize the collection, processing, and transfer of your personal information for the purpose of this study. You do not have to sign this form. But if you do not, you will not be able to participate in this research study.</p>

</ul> 
<p>We may review your account information, study data, and signed consent form for regulatory compliance and/or quality assurance.</p> 
<p>We respect your privacy. We will never sell, rent, or lease your contact information. We will not disclose your personal information unless the law requires us to. Please read our Privacy Policy for more information (parkinsonmpower.org).</p> 
<h3><em><strong>Who may use and disclose your Personal Information?</strong></em></h3> 
<p>We may use and disclose your personal information to do this research. Our team includes the study sponsors, the investigators, the study coordinators, and study staff. We may also disclose your personal information as required by law. For example, we may be required to disclose your personal information to prevent possible injury to yourself or others.</p> 
<h3><em><strong>Who May Receive or Use your Personal Information?</strong></em></h3> 
<p>If required by law, we may disclose your information to:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>&#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0;The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Office for Human Research Protection (OHRP), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and other agencies for review of our research procedures.</li> 
 <li>&#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0;Western Institutional Review Board® (WIRB®) or other Institutional Review Board (IRB) so they can monitor the safety, effectiveness, and conduct of our research.</li> 
 <li>&#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0;Others, if the law requires.</li> 
</ul> 
<h3><em><strong>When will my authorization expire?</strong></em></h3> 
<p>Your authorization allows us to use and disclose your personal information for the purpose of this study. Your authorization will end if you withdraw from this study. If you do not withdraw, your authorization will end on December 31, 2060. Your authorization may end sooner depending on any time limitations imposed by law.</p> 
<p>If you withdraw from this study, we will stop collecting your study data. If you do not withdraw, we will stop collecting your data at the end of the study period. We will stop even if you keep using the app.</p> 
<p>If you were interested in joining another study, we would ask you to complete a new consent. The new consent will be like this one. It will explain the risks and benefits of the new study.<br /> &#xa0;</p> 
<h2><strong>PRIVACY, CONFIDENTIALITY, and DATA PROTECTION</strong></h2> 
<p>Your privacy is important to us. We will make every effort to protect your privacy. Except as required by law, you will not be identified by name or by any other direct personal identifier. However, if there is a data breach it may be possible to identify you. This risk is low but it is not zero.&#xa0;</p> 
<h3><em><strong>Data de-identification</strong></em></h3> 
<p>The data we collect through the app will be encrypted on your phone. This means your data is protected. Unauthorized people will not be able to access the data on your phone easily.</p> 
<p>We will process your data electronically. We will separate your study data from the account information that identifies you. Your account information will not be stored with your survey responses or activity measurements.</p> 
<p>Instead of using your name, we will use a code to label your study data. The code is random. It is not based on any of your identifiable information. Information about the code will be stored in a separate database on a secure server. Only key people from our study team will be able to link your identity to your study data.</p> 
<p>We will combine your coded study data with the coded study data of other volunteers. We will store this combined coded study data in the United States on the Synapse data analysis platform. Synapse is run by Sage Bionetworks (non-profit).</p> 
<p>We will NOT access other apps on your phone. We will NOT access your contacts, photos, texts, email, or browsing history. We will never sell, rent, or lease your contact information.</p> 
<h3><em><strong>Where will my data be stored?</strong></em></h3> 
<p>Your study data will be encrypted on your phone. Your coded study data will be sent from your phone to the study team automatically. We store your coded study data in a way that keeps your information as safe as possible. We use a hosted computing environment, also known as a “cloud server,” to store it. This cloud server is based in the United States.</p> 
<p>We follow the most current data protection standards. We take the security of your coded study data very seriously. For more information about data storage, see the <a href="https://www.synapse.org/#!Wiki:syn2502577/ENTITY">Synapse Governance Overview</a>.</p> 
<h3><em><strong>How is my coded study data used in research?</strong></em></h3> 
<p>We will combine your coded study data with the coded study data of other volunteers. We will use this combined pool of data for our research. The results of our research will be made public. When results are made public, only coded study data will be used. Your identity will not be shared.</p> 
<p>The same coded study data that you donate for mPower could be used for other research. We give you the option to share your coded study data with other researchers worldwide for other research.</p> 
<p>You get to decide if you want to share your coded study data for other research. Here are three important points to consider when deciding:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>First, research using the shared coded study data can be on any topic, not just PD. The research might be on topics you disagree with or find offensive.</li> 
 <li>Second, anyone can apply to access the shared coded study data. Researchers might be from commercial (for profit) companies, like drug manufacturers or from academic institutions like a University.</li> 
 <li>Third, research using the shared coded study data may lead to patentable discoveries or commercial product(s). You will not profit from these discoveries or products. For example, you will not be paid for being in the study and/or sharing your data.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Think carefully about sharing your coded study data for other research. Make the choice that feels right for you.</p> 
<h3><strong><em>How is location data used?</em></strong></h3> 
<p>Some study activities use your phone’s GPS. We use the GPS to calculate how far you travel. For this reason, when you register, you will be asked for permission to access your GPS. We do NOT use the GPS to find out your location.</p> 
<h3><em><strong>Is there risk to privacy?</strong></em></h3> 
<p>We take great care to protect your privacy. However, if there is a data breach it may be possible to identify you. Because your study data will be coded it will not be easy to figure out your identity. The risk to your privacy is low but it is not zero.</p> 
<h3><strong><em>Listing on ClinicalTrials.gov</em></strong></h3> 
<p>ClinicalTrials.gov is a website where clinical studies are listed. This website is hosted by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH). At this time, we are not required by law to list this study. However, the NIH encourages all researchers to list their studies.</p> 
<p>If we list this study, we will not include information that can identify you. We will describe the study in general terms. At most we may include a summary of the results. You can search ClinicalTrials.gov at any time (<a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">https://clinicaltrials.gov/</a>).</p> 
<h2><strong>COMPENSATION FOR INJURY</strong></h2> 
<p>THIS STUDY DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY COMPENSATION, HEALTH OR MEDICAL CARE TO PARTICIPANTS.&#xa0;</p> 
<p>If you are injured as a direct result of your participation in this study, we will assist you in getting medical care for your injury. Your medical insurance, managed care plan, or other benefits program will be billed for this treatment. You will be responsible for any insurance co-payments or deductibles.</p> 
<p>If the cost of caring for your injury is not covered, you may be responsible for those costs. We and the other study sponsors do not usually pay charges that are not covered by insurance. No payment is routinely available from us or the other study sponsors.</p> 
<h2><strong>VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION AND WITHDRAWAL</strong></h2> 
<p>Your participation is voluntary. You get to decide if you would like to volunteer.</p> 
<p>You do not have to sign this consent form. If you do not sign this consent form you will not be able to participate in this research study.</p> 
<p>If you do join the study, you may quit at any time. Your decision will not result in any penalty or loss of benefits.</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>You should not feel obligated to participate in this study.</li> 
 <li>Your questions should be answered clearly and to your satisfaction.</li> 
 <li>You have a right to download or transfer a copy of all of your study data.</li> 
 <li>By agreeing to participate you do not waive any of your legal rights.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>If you want to quit the study, there are two ways to withdraw. You can do so directly from your app profile page. Or you can contact the Study Principal Investigator Lara Mangravite&#xa0;PhD, by email <a href="mailto:PDApp@sagebionetworks.org">PDApp@sagebionetworks.org</a> or call (206) 667-2129&#xa0;or toll-free (844) 822-4708.</p> 
<p>Although you can quit at any time, you cannot take back the coded study data that was collected before you quit. Your coded study data from before your withdrawal will still be used in the study. It cannot be destroyed or deleted.</p> 
<p>The study team may also withdraw you from the study at any time for any reason. One reason we might withdraw you is if we feel it is in your best interest. Another reason is if you do not consent to continue in the study after being told of changes in the research. We would withdraw you if the study was cancelled.</p>
